// Arrow functions
// This is a function that was introduced in the ECMA Script 6 and they give us the latest/modern way of defining functions in compact manner.
// At times the arrow function can be said to be anonymous functions why? This is because they use the names of the variables they are contained in.


const sayHello = () => {
    console.log("This is an Arrow Function.")
}


sayHello();

console.log("=========================")
// create an arrow function that is able to find the product of three numbers.

const product = (a,b,c) => a*b*c;{
    console.log(product(2,3,4));
}
